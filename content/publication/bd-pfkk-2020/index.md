abstract: We study a Markov birth-and-death process on a space of locally finite configurations,
  which describes an ecological model with a density-dependent fecundity regulation
  mechanism. We establish existence and uniqueness of this process and analyze its
  properties. In particular, we show global time-space boundedness of the population
  density and, using a constructed Fosterâ€“Lyapunov-type function, we study return
  times to certain level sets of tempered configurations. We also find sufficient
  conditions that the degenerate invariant distribution is unique for the considered
  process.
