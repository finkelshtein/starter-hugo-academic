abstract: Abstract In ecology, one of the most fundamental questions relates to the
  persistence of populations, or conversely to the probability of their extinction.
  Deriving extinction thresholds and characterizing other critical phenomena in spatial
  and stochastic models is highly challenging, with few mathematically rigorous results
  being available for discrete-space models such as the contact process. For continuous-space
  models of interacting agents, to our knowledge no analytical results are available
  concerning critical phenomena, even if continuous-space models can arguably be considered
  to be more natural descriptions of many ecological systems than lattice-based models.
  Here we present both mathematical and simulation-based methods for deriving extinction
  thresholds and other critical phenomena in a broad class of agent-based models called
  spatiotemporal point processes. The mathematical methods are based on a perturbation
  expansion around the so-called mean-field model, which is obtained at the limit
  of large-scale interactions. The simulation methods are based on examining how the
  mean time to extinction scales with the domain size used in the simulation. By utilizing
  a constrained Gaussian process fitted to the simulated data, the critical parameter
  value can be identified by asking when the scaling between logarithms of the time
  to extinction and the domain size switches from sublinear to superlinear. As a case
  study, we derive the extinction threshold for the spatial and stochastic logistic
  model. The mathematical technique yields rigorous approximation of the extinction
  threshold at the limit of long-ranged interactions. The asymptotic validity of the
  approximation is illustrated by comparing it to simulation experiments. In particular,
  we show that species persistence is facilitated by either short or long spatial
  scale of the competition kernel, whereas an intermediate scale makes the species
  vulnerable to extinction. Both the mathematical and simulation methods developed
  here are of very general nature, and thus we expect them to be valuable for predicting
  many kinds of critical phenomena in continuous-space stochastic models of interacting
  agents, and thus to be of broad interest for research in theoretical ecology and
  evolutionary biology.
