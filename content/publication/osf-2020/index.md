abstract: Agent-based models are used to study complex phenomena in many fields of
  science. While simulating agent-based models is often straightforward, predicting
  their behaviour mathematically has remained a key challenge. Recently developed
  mathematical methods allow the prediction of the emerging spatial patterns for a
  general class of agent-based models, whereas the prediction of spatio-temporal pattern
  has been thus far achieved only for special cases. We present a general and mathematically
  rigorous methodology that allows deriving the spatio-temporal correlation structure
  for a general class of individual-based models. To do so, we define an auxiliary
  model, in which each agent type of the primary model expands to three types, called
  the original, the past and the new agents. In this way, the auxiliary model keeps
  track of both the initial and current state of the primary model, and hence the
  spatio-temporal correlations of the primary model can be derived from the spatial
  correlations of the auxiliary model. We illustrate the agreement between analytical
  predictions and agent-based simulations using two example models from theoretical
  ecology. In particular, we show that the methodology is able to correctly predict
  the dynamical behaviour of a hostâ€“parasite model that shows spatially localized
  oscillations.
